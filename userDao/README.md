### about database
this code uses mysql, the mysql configuration in /resource/hibernate.cfg.xml file. mysql address: mysql://localhost:/test , user name:root, password:2010104 (that just on my machine) you can alter it due to your own situation.
**notes the table schema:**
database name: test, table name: user
*CREATE TABLE user(id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name CHAR(30), address CHAR(50))*
